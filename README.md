## Step 1: Check for VirtualBox

To get started, ensure you have **VirtualBox** installed. If not, you can download it from [this link](https://www.virtualbox.org/). **VirtualBox** is essential for setting up the operating system we’ll be working with.

At 1337, **VirtualBox** is already available on the macOS devices, so you likely won’t need to install it. Double-check whether it’s already installed on your machine before proceeding.

### Some things you need to learn

- **VirtualBox**: Understand what VirtualBox is and how it works as a virtualization tool.
- **Virtualization**: Learn the concept of virtualization and its role in creating virtual environments.
- **Operating Systems**: Familiarize yourself with what operating systems are and their importance in managing computer hardware and software.
- **Hypervisor**: Discover the role of a hypervisor and how it enables virtualization by managing virtual machines.

## Step 2: Selecting the Operating System

### Debian vs Rocky Linux

When considering the operating system for the "**Born2beroot**" project, **Debian** stands out as the top recommendation. Here’s why:

1. **Stability and Reliability**: Debian is renowned for its robust stability, making it an ideal choice for server environments. With its established release cycle and thorough documentation, it offers a smooth experience for both beginners and advanced users alike.

2. **Extensive Community Support**: Debian is supported by a vibrant and engaged community, with a wealth of online resources to assist you. This active support network is especially valuable if you’re just starting out in system administration.

3. **Ideal for System Administration**: As specifically recommended for newcomers to system administration, Debian’s user-friendly package management (apt) and comprehensive documentation simplify the learning process. It’s a great choice for implementing essential tasks required by the project.

4. **Robust Security**: Debian comes with solid security features, including SELinux, which should be enabled at startup and configured as per the project requirements. AppArmor is also necessary to run at startup, adding another layer of security to the system.

5. **Project Compatibility**: Debian’s capabilities align perfectly with the project’s needs. From setting up encrypted partitions with LVM to implementing a strict password policy, configuring sudo, managing SSH access, and setting up a firewall with UFW, Debian supports all these requirements.

6. **Bonus Features**: Should you opt for the bonus section of the project, Debian provides a stable environment for additional services, like setting up WordPress or any custom service you prefer.

7. **Current Version**: The most recent stable version of Debian, as of this guide’s writing, is Debian 12.5. You can download the image from [this link](https://www.debian.org/download).

In conclusion, Debian offers a dependable, secure, and well-documented platform that fits perfectly with the project’s needs. It’s an excellent choice for gaining hands-on experience in system administration while ensuring your environment is well-supported and aligned with the project’s goals.
